### **Description**

A React built application showing use of components and utilizing state to control element function. The application displays players
with an input field that can add as many players or delete them as needed.  The score is manually adjusted up or down with each player
and changing state within the application.  The scores are totaled amongst all players as well as the total number of players is displayed
when adding or subtracting a player from the board.  The application shows use of 'prop-types' and is from an older version of the framework
by use of the variable and class decleration which syntax has now changed.  There is a timer for a game that can be used that makes use
of the 'setInterval' command so it can be stopped, restarted, and reset.

This application is on the surface level of React capabilities.
